Technical Report
================

(intro describing purpose of report - 200ish words)

This report endeavors to delve into the intricacies of programming frameworks and languages, their significance and utility in addressing programming-related challenges. To accomplish this objective, an examination of various features pertaining to both client and server aspects of Frameworks/Languages will be conducted. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of an existing prototype will be undertaken, aiming to identify potential shortcomings and ascertain its compatibility within a corporate environment.

Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### Overview

### CORS Default Parameter

`./example_server/app/http_server.py`
```python
RESPONSE_DEFAULTS = {
    'code': 200, 
    'body': '',
    'Content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
    'Server': 'CustomHTTP/0.0 Python/3.9.0+',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
}
```

These are the default responses set on this web-server unless it has been specified/overridden elsewhere. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` has been set by default to allow outside domains to access our server, which makes this server vulnerable to possible security related issues
